                    <h3>QuickThought</h3>
                    <p>QuickThought is a cross-platform application I am developing with my partner, Azizul Hakim Ananda, using the Flutter framework. I led a team of computer science and business majors to bring this vision to life, ensuring seamless collaboration between technical and strategic elements. Our goal is to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and organization for college students worldwide. After securing third place in Skidmore College's Kenneth A. Freirich Entrepreneurship Competition in 2024, we are excited to showcase our latest innovations at the 2025 competition.</p>

                    <h3>Fullstack Machine Learning Integration</h3>
                    <p>This project showcases a framework I'm building to integrate machine learning models into web applications. For the conceptual stage, I trained a lightweight TensorFlow Keras model, which is being used as a proof of concept. The framework leverages RESTful AWS instances for cost-efficient performance and will support seamless integration of any model with front-end user interfaces.</p>

                    <h3>CommUnity</h3>
                    <p>CommUnity is a web application designed to empower urban communities by fostering collective action and amplifying their voices to enact meaningful change. At a hackathon at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), I led a team of front-end and back-end developers, contributing my expertise in back-end development to ensure a seamless integration of features. This project combines modern technology with community collaboration to create a streamlined platform for advocacy.</p>

                    <h3>Aurapolis</h3>
                    <p>Aurapolis is a browser-based strategy game designed to immerse players in a world of tactical decision-making and resource management. I brought together a global team of graphic designers and web developers from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the Netherlands, uniting us around our shared passion for fair competition and strategic depth in games. As the team lead, I coordinated development efforts and conceptual design to create a learning experience that explores and understands complex web systems while emphasizing skill over monetary investment.</p>
