                    <h3>QuickThought</h3>
                    <p>Quickthought is a cross-platform application I am developing with my partner, Azizul Hakim Ananda, using the Flutter framework. Our goal is to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and organization for college students worldwide. After securing third place in Skidmore College's Kenneth A. Freirich Entrepreneurship Competition in 2024, we are excited to showcase our latest innovations at the 2025 competition.</p>

                    <h3>Fullstack Machine Learning Integration</h3>
                    <p>This project showcases a framework I'm building to integrate machine learning models into web applications. For the conceptual stage, I trained a lightweight TensorFlow Keras model, which is being used as a proof of concept. The framework leverages RESTful AWS instances for cost-efficient performance and will support seamless integration of any model with front-end user interfaces.</p>
