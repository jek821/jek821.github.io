                    <h3>QuickThought</h3>
                    <p>Quickthought is a cross-platform application I am developing with my partner, Azizul Hakim
                        Ananda, using the Flutter framework. Our goal is to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and
                        organization for college students worldwide. After securing third place in Skidmore College's
                        Kenneth A. Freirich Entrepreneurship Competition in 2024, we are excited to showcase our latest
                        innovations at the 2025 competition.</p>

                    <h3>Fullstack Machine Learning Integration</h3>
                    <p>This project began as an experimental design integrating a handwritten numbers model into a web
                        application using TensorFlow Keras. It has since evolved to leverage AWS Textract for converting
                        handwritten and written text into digital text. The application integrates machine learning
                        models and AWS services into a Vue/Vite frontend and a Node.js Express backend, showcasing how
                        advanced AI capabilities can be made accessible through web interfaces. This experimental
                        approach highlights scalable and efficient methods for connecting machine learning with
                        practical applications.</p>

                    <h3>CommUnity</h3>
                    <p>CommUnity is a web application designed to empower urban communities by fostering collective
                        action and turning local activism into constructive correspondence with government officials.
                        Originally conceived and developed at a hackathon at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI),
                        CommUnity features a Tailwind CSS frontend, a Firestore database for real-time data management,
                        and a Flask API integrated with ChatGPT for generating impactful advocacy messages. The backend
                        is hosted on AWS Lambda, ensuring scalability and reliability. This combination of modern
                        technologies creates a streamlined platform for community-driven advocacy and meaningful change.

                    <h3>Aether Kingdoms</h3>
                    <p>Aether Kingdoms is a browser-based strategy game designed and developed by a skilled web
                        developer with a passion for strategy games. While the project is largely his creation, I have
                        had the opportunity to contribute minimally and, more importantly, to learn from his expertise.
                        This experience has allowed me to deepen my understanding of database management with SQL,
                        explore API integration across full-stack applications, and gain insight into the ecosystem of
                        web-based game development. Aether Kingdoms reflects a commitment to fair competition and
                        strategic depth, rejecting pay-to-win models and celebrating skill-based gameplay.</p>
